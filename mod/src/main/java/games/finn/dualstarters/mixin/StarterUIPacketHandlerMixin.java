/**
 * Replaces Cobblemon's single-starter selection screen with the Dual Starters picker.
 *
 * <p>This is the single interception point: Cobblemon only sends
 * {@link OpenStarterUIPacket} to a client when the server-side flow decided the player
 * should choose a starter (i.e. {@code !starterSelected && !starterLocked}). So by taking
 * over the open here, we inherit Cobblemon's "new player" gate and its trigger (the same
 * keybind/flow that opens the normal starter menu), and reopening works for free.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code remap = false} because the target is a Cobblemon class, not a Minecraft class;
 * its names are literal and must not be run through Minecraft's mapping.</p>
